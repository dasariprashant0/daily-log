// AtomicFile.swift - crash-safe replace of a file, used for day files and backups. Foundation + POSIX only.
//
// Why not Data.write(.atomic) / String.write(atomically:)? Those write a temp file named "<name>.sb-xxxxxxxx-xxxxxx" next to the
// target; a SIGKILL or crash mid-write leaves it there for good: visible in Finder and sync clients, counted as an "unrecognised
// file" in Settings, never cleaned (found by tests/run-kill-tests.sh in 36 of 40 rounds). Here the temp file is named by us:
//   ".gloamlog-tmp-<pid of the writer>-<uuid>"   hidden (dot file), so it is never listed as a day, a backup or an unrecognised file.
// write(_:to:)  1. the bytes go to the temp file (in `tempDir`, default the target's folder; must be on the target's volume),
//               2. fsync, 3. the target's permissions are copied onto it (as Foundation's atomic write did), 4. rename(2) over the
//               target. The target is therefore always either its old complete content or the new complete content. If anything
//               fails the temp file is removed again and the error is thrown. Like Foundation's, a symlink at the target is replaced.
// sweep(in:)    removes ".gloamlog-tmp-*" files whose writer process is no longer running (the leftovers of a kill). A temp file of a
//               live process, including this one, is never touched; anything not starting with the prefix is never touched.
