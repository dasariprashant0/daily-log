// AppModel+Capture.swift - quick capture ("Jot") wired into the app (M2, task U3): the journal and the single writer, which
// open page a note goes to, when waiting notes are retried, the global shortcut, and the panel.
//
// The rule that makes capture safe: a note is durable in the journal (fsynced) BEFORE anything else happens to it. After that it
// is routed by what is open (Core/Capture/DayWriter.swift): the live editor when today's page is open, the file when it is
// not, and it simply waits when neither can take it. The journal is retried when the folder returns, when the app comes
// forward, after a wake, after a folder change, and when a page finishes loading, so a note is never lost and never added twice.
